  <h2><b>The Tragic Tale of Philomela and Procne</b> (Greek Mythology)</h2>

  <!-- Row for text and image -->

      <h4>The Background: A Royal Bloodline</h4>
      <p>Long ago, in the city of Athens, King Pandion had two beautiful daughters: <strong>Procne</strong> and <strong>Philomela</strong>. Their bond was unbreakable, and they spent their days together, singing and weaving tapestries.</p>
      <p>One day, a powerful Thracian king, <strong>Tereus</strong>, came to Athens seeking an alliance. He fought alongside King Pandion in a war, and as a reward, Pandion gave him Procne’s hand in marriage. Though Procne was reluctant, she was sent to Thrace as Tereus’ wife.</p>
      <p>Years passed, and Procne longed for her sister. She asked Tereus to bring Philomela to visit.</p>

      <h4>The Betrayal</h4>
      <p>Tereus set sail for Athens, but as soon as he laid eyes on Philomela, he became obsessed. Instead of taking her to Thrace as promised, <strong>he abducted her, took her deep into a forest, and imprisoned her in a hidden cabin</strong>.</p>
      <p>Philomela, enraged, vowed to tell the world of his crimes. Terrified of being exposed, Tereus <strong>cut out her tongue, leaving her mute</strong>. He then told Procne that her sister had died.</p>

      <h4>The Silent Message</h4>
      <p>But Philomela was not defeated. Unable to speak, she used her skills in weaving. She <strong>created a tapestry that told her story</strong>, embedding images of her suffering into the fabric. She secretly sent it to her sister.</p>
      <p>When Procne saw it, she was overcome with rage. She devised a terrible revenge.</p>

      <h4 class="pt-3">The Bloody Feast</h4>
      <p>Procne freed her sister and, in her madness, killed her own son, Itys—the only thing Tereus truly loved. She <strong>cooked his body into a meal</strong> and served it to her husband.</p>
      <p>Tereus ate, unaware. When Procne revealed the truth, he <strong>vomited in horror</strong> and chased the sisters, wielding his sword.</p>
      <p>Just as he was about to strike them down, the gods intervened, transforming them:</p>

    <div class="col-md-12">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Philomela became a swallow</b>, a bird that cannot sing but forever flutters restlessly.</li>
        <li><b>Procne became a nightingale</b>, whose sorrowful song echoes through the night.</li>
        <li><b>Tereus was turned into a hoopoe</b>, a bird cursed to wander alone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>The Meaning</h4>
      <p>This myth links swallows to sorrow, survival, and unspoken pain. Philomela’s transformation symbolizes <strong>the voices of the oppressed</strong>, eternally present in nature.</p>
