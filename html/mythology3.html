            <h4 class="mb-3">The Kind Farmer and the Injured Swallow</h4>
            <p>Long ago, in a quiet village surrounded by golden rice fields, lived an <strong>old farmer named Gorō</strong>. He was a humble man who worked tirelessly in his paddies from sunrise to sunset. Though he had little, he always <strong>shared what he had</strong>, offering rice to the birds and animals who visited his fields.</p>
            <p>One cold autumn morning, as he was threshing rice outside his home, Gorō heard a faint <strong>chirping sound</strong>. He looked around and saw a <strong>small swallow struggling in the grass</strong>. Its tiny wing was <strong>broken</strong>, and it could not fly.</p>
            <p>Feeling pity for the poor creature, Gorō gently picked it up and <strong>brought it into his home</strong>. He carefully <strong>bandaged its wing</strong>, fed it rice grains, and <strong>kept it warm</strong> in a little woven basket by the hearth.</p>
            <p>As days passed, the swallow <strong>grew stronger</strong>, and soon it was able to <strong>flutter its wings</strong> again. One morning, it perched on Gorō’s shoulder and <strong>chirped joyfully</strong>. It was time to leave.</p>
            <p>As he opened his window, the swallow hopped onto the sill, looked back at him, and then flew away into the sky.</p>
            <p>Gorō sighed. “Be safe, little one.”</p>


            <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">The Mysterious Gift of the Swallow</h4>
            <p>Winter came and went, and soon the cherry blossoms <strong>began to bloom</strong>. One morning, as Gorō was preparing to plant new rice seedlings, he heard a <strong>familiar chirping</strong> outside his home.</p>
            <p>To his amazement, a <strong>flock of swallows</strong> had gathered on his rooftop, and among them was the very same <strong>swallow he had rescued</strong>. It held something in its beak <strong>a small, golden seed</strong> and dropped it into Gorō’s hands before flying away.</p>
            <p>Curious, Gorō <strong>planted the seed</strong> in a corner of his rice paddy. Within days, a <strong>strange plant</strong> sprouted, growing faster than any rice he had ever seen. Its leaves were <strong>bright green</strong>, and its stalks shimmered like <strong>gold</strong>.</p>
            <p>When harvest time came, Gorō found that instead of ordinary rice grains, the plant had produced <strong>golden grains</strong>, each one as precious as a <strong>pearl</strong>. Overjoyed, he used them to buy better tools, help his neighbors, and repair the village shrine.</p>
            <p>His fortune <strong>grew</strong>, and word of the "Golden Rice of the Swallow" spread throughout the land. But Gorō never became greedy—he always <strong>shared his blessings with others</strong>, remembering that the swallow had given him this gift out of kindness.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">The Jealous Neighbor's Fate</h4>
            <p>One day, Gorō’s neighbor, <strong>a greedy man named Saburō</strong>, heard about the golden rice and <strong>became envious</strong>. He thought, “If a swallow could bring fortune to Gorō, I will catch one and force it to give me golden seeds, too!”</p>
            <p>So, Saburō <strong>trapped a swallow</strong> in a bamboo cage and broke its wing, thinking it would have no choice but to give him treasure. But instead of golden seeds, when he released it in spring, the swallow <strong>never returned</strong>.</p>
            <p>The following year, a <strong>terrible storm</strong> destroyed Saburō’s rice fields, and he <strong>lost everything</strong>. In his greed, he had brought misfortune upon himself.</p>

            <h4 class="mb-3">The Meaning of the Swallow’s Tale</h4>
            <p>To this day, swallows in Japan are seen as symbols of <strong>good luck and protection</strong>, especially if they choose to <strong>nest in your home or barn</strong>.</p>
            <p>People believe that <strong>showing kindness to swallows</strong> will <strong>bring prosperity and happiness</strong>, just as the kind farmer was rewarded for his good heart. But harming them out of <strong>greed brings misfortune</strong>, just like the jealous neighbor.</p>
            <p>So, when spring arrives, and you see swallows darting through the sky, remember:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They are not just birds; <b>they are messengers of fortune</b>.</li>
                <li>They reward those who show <b>compassion and gratitude</b>.</li>
                <li>And if one ever builds a nest in your home, <b>welcome it with an open heart—for it may bring blessings in return</b>.</li>
            </ul>
